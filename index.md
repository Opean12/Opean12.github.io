# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 5, Part 1

    This lab was also fun because I made a program that would calculate the area of a rectangle for me. I thought this lab was basic and allowed me to understand how I could do multiplication with the code. Additionally it improved my understanding of how doubles and ints work. Double are more exact that integers because they have a decimal point and integers are just the number and not as exact.

* Lab 6, Part 2

    This lab was about blackjack which is a game that I find fun. This lab taught me a lot about how complex a simple game can be. It allowed me to understand that I can allow only a certain number of arguments on a command line. Additionally it showed me how complex if statements can be if you don’t make them clear. I also learned boolean operators which allowed me to add “and”, “or”, and “not” to my boolean statements.

* Lab 7, Part 1

    This lab was fun because I got used to making if statements. I had to make if statements that allowed cars to park on a street on a certain day and a certain time. I also learned to use the not boolean operator to make a statement not true so that everything else in the code could work. Additionally I learned how to use else if statements so that I can make the code go through the whole statement to check if it is one of the streets.
